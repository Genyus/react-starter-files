# 🎉 React Starter Files!

This repository, set up as a simple [monorepo](https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/what-monorepo#what), is your starting point. Follow the step-by-step instructions to set up your local development environment, and get ready for some fun!

## 🛠️ Set Up Your Local Development Environment

1. **Fork This Repository:** Click the 'Fork' button at the top of this repository to create a copy under your personal account.

2. **Clone The Forked Repository:** Now, you need to bring the forked repository onto your local machine. Replace `{your_github_username}` with your actual Github username (like 'janesmith'). Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:{your_github_username}/react-starter-files.git
```

3. **Navigate Into Your Cloned Repository:** After cloning the repository onto your machine, enter the directory by running the following command:

```sh
cd react-starter-files
```

4. **Install Dependencies:** While inside your project's root directory, install all the necessary dependencies using this command:

```sh
npm install
```

Now, you're ready to dive into individual tasks! 🏊‍♀️

## 🧭 How to Navigate Through Tasks

Each task comes with its own dedicated folder. To work on a task, you'll need to navigate to its folder. For example, if you're working on the "build-a-car" task, you would enter its directory using the command `cd build-a-car`.

After entering the specific task's directory, you can initiate the development environment. Simply run the following command from inside the task's directory:

```sh
npm run start
```

(Note: Make sure to replace "build-a-car" with the name of the task you're currently tackling.)

Happy Coding! 🚀
